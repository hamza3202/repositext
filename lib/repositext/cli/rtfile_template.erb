# This is an example Rtfile with default settings that run out of the box.
# Modify the DSL methods below to suit your repository layout.

# File patterns
# -------------

# Provide a name and a file pattern string (or block that returns a string) for
# each file pattern.
# It is recommended to expand paths relative to the location of this Rtfile
# so that they work independently of the user's current working directory.
# (Rather than using the current working directory).

file_pattern :import_folio_xml, File.expand_path("initial_folio_import/folio/**/*.xml", __FILE__)
file_pattern :import_idml,      File.expand_path("initial_idml_import/idml/**/*.idml", __FILE__)

# Kramdown Parsers
# ----------------

# Provide a name and a Parser's class name as string

kramdown_parser :folio_xml, 'Kramdown::Parser::Folio'
kramdown_parser :idml,      'Kramdown::Parser::Idml'

# Kramdown Converter Methods
# --------------------------

# Provide a name and a method name to be used for conversion.

kramdown_converter_method :to_at,         :to_kramdown
kramdown_converter_method :to_icml,       :to_icml
kramdown_converter_method :to_idml_story, :to_icml_story
