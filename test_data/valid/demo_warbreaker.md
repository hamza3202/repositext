   There were great advantages to being unimportant.

1	True, by many people’s standards, Siri wasn’t “unimportant.” She was, after all, the daughter of a king. Fortunately, her father had four living children, and Siri—at seventeen years of age—was the y-o-u-n-g-e-s-t. Fafen, the daughter just older than Siri, had done the family duty and become a monk. [Above Fafen was Ridger, the eldest son. He would inherit the throne.—Tr.]

People would notice, of course, and she would get into trouble. Yet even her father would have to admit that her disappearance hadn’t caused much inconvenience. The city got along just fine without Siri—in fact, it tended to do a little better when she wasn’t around.

123	Unimportance. To another, it might have: been offensive. To Siri it was a blessing. She smiled, walking into the city proper. She drew the inevitable stares. While Bevalis was technically the capital of Idris,—it—wasn’t—that—big, and everyone knew her by sight. Judging by the stories Siri had heard from passing ramblemen, her home was hardly even a village compared with the massive metropolises in other nations.

124	She liked it the way it was, even with the: muddy streets, the thatched cottages, and the boring—yet sturdy—stone walls. Women chasing runaway geese, men pulling donkeys laden with spring seed, and children leading sheep on their way to pasture. A grand city in Xaka, Hudres, or even terrible Hallandren might have exotic sights, but it would be crowded with faceless, shouting, jostling crowds, and haughty noblemen. Not Siri’s preference; she generally found even Bevalis to be a bit busy for her.

127	As she continued through the town, a group of small figures began trailing her. She smiled, pretending to ignore the children until one of them was brave enough to run forward and tug on her dress. Then she turned, smiling. They regarded her with solemn faces. Idrian children were trained even at this age to avoid shameful outbursts of *emotion*{:.underline}. Austrin teachings said there was nothing wrong with feelings, but drawing attention to yourself with them was wrong.

*The flowers stood out starkly against the town’s determined drabness. Other than what one could find in the skin and* eyes *of the people, there wasn’t a drop of color in sight. Stones had been whitewashed, clothing bleached grey or tan. All to* keep *the color away.*

*For without color, there could be no* Awakeners.

*The girl who had tugged Siri’s skirt finally took the flowers in one hand and dashed away with them, the other children following behind. Siri* caught *a look of disproval in the eyes of several passing villagers. None of them confronted her, though. Being a princess—even an unimportant one—did have its perks.*

1	“I like words,” Siri said. “And I always learn a few new ones when ‘Father…?…gets angry’. I shouldn’t neglect my education, now should I?”

1	Mab snorted, dicing some pickled cucumbers into the onions.

1	“‘Honestly, Mab,’” Siri said, twirling the flower, feeling her hair shade a little bit red. “I don’t see ‘what the problem’ is. Austre made the flowers, right? He put the colors on them, so they can’t be evil. [I mean, we call him God of Colors, for heaven’s sake.”—Ed.]

**1.	“Flowers ain’t evil,” Mab said, adding something that looked like** grass to her concoction, **“assuming they’re left where Austre put them…We shouldn’t use Austre’s beauty to make ourselves more important.”**
{:.q}

**12.	“A flower** doesn’t make **me look *more* important.”**
{:.q}

**123.	“Oh?” Mab asked, adding the grass, cucumber, and onions to one of her boiling pots…She banged the side of the pot with the flat** of her knife, listening, **then nodded to** herself **and began fishing under the counter for more vegetables. “You tell me,” she continued, voice muffled. “You really think walking through the city with a flower like that didn’t draw attention to yourself?”**

1	“That’s only because the city is so drab. If there were a bit of color around, nobody would notice a flower.”

1	“That sacrificing-maidens…part is only a story,” Siri said. “They don’t really do that.”

1	“Stories come from somewhere.”

1	“Yes, they come from old women sitting by the hearth in the winter. I don’t think we need to be so frightened. The Hallandren will do what they want…which is fine by me, as long as they leave us alone.”

1	Mab chopped tubers, not looking up.

1	“We’ve got the treaty, Mab,” Siri said. “Father and Vivenna will make sure we’re safe, and that will make the Hallandren leave us alone.”

“And if they don’t?”
{:.song}

“They will. You don’t need to worry.”
{:.song}

1	“They have better armies,” Mab said, chopping, not looking up, “better steel, more food, and those…those things. It makes people…?…worry. Maybe not you, but sensible folk.”

1	The cook’s words were hard to dismiss out of hand. Mab had a sense, a…wisdom *beyond* her instinct for spices and broths. However, she also tended to fret. “You’re worrying about nothing, Mab. You’ll see.”

“I’m just saying that this is a bad time for a royal princess to be running around with flowers, standin’ out and inviting Austre’s dislike.”
{:.song}

Siri sighed. “Fine, then,” she said, tossing her last flower into the stewpot. “Now we can all stand out *together*.”
{:.song}

Mab froze, then rolled her eyes, chopping a root. “I assume that was a vanavel flower?”
{:.song}

“Of course,” Siri said, sniffing at the steaming pot. “I know better than to ruin a good stew. And I still say you’re overreacting.”
{:.song}

Mab sniffed. “Here,” she said, pulling out another knife. “Make yourself useful. There’s roots that need choppin’.”

1	Dedelin glanced back at the letter. The paper was a bright pink, and the garish color stood out on his desk like a drop of blood in the snow. Pink was a color one would never see in Idris. In Hallandren, however—center of the world’s dye industry—such tasteless hues were commonplace.

1	“Well, old friend?” Dedelin asked. “Do you have any advice for me?”

1	General Yarda shook his head. “War is coming, Your Majesty. I feel it in the winds and…read it in the reports of our spies. Hallandren still considers us rebels, and our passes to the north are too tempting. They will attack.”   
